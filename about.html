Hello! My name is Thomas Nolte, I'm a Mechatronics Engineer interested in robotics, controls, and automation design.
I graduated in May 2019 with a Joint B.S. Mechatronics Degree from the University of North Carolina in Asheville and North Carolina State University.
I'm most at home in a shop, from woodworking and machining, to mentoring FIRST robotics team 4828 in Raleigh, NC.
In my free time I love to build and paint miniatures, play Magic: The Gathering, and to cook for friends and family.
