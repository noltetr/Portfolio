During my time at Enloe High School in Raleigh, North Carolina I participated in Science Olympiad for 4 years and FIRST Robotics for my final 2 years.
It was a profoundly influential time of my life where I grew to love engineering. I became deeply committed to each of these programs and continue to mentor
FRC team #4828 the RoboEagles.
