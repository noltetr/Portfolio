BumbleBee is a 3D printer myself and 3 other students built for our Junior Design class at UNCA.
The goal of the class was to introduce and teach students about 3D printers and also inprove our planning and team working skills.

In the beginning of the class we learned about different types of 3D printers and their advantages and disadvantages.
We were then split into teams of 4 to build and design a 3D and would be graded on how accurate we could print a 1 inch cube, an Elephant, and Boaty.
After brainstorming with my partners we decided that our printer design would focus on speed and accuracy
Our design utilized a bowden extruder and mono-filament line to redue the mass and momentum in the extruder carraige.
By reducing the mass of the carraige it allowed us to run the printer at a faster speed and the mono-filament line's inductileness it provided a much more accurate movement system then the belts used by the Prusa printer we were originally given.
In addition to using prefabricated parts we also used a Prusa-3 where we printed custom parts for our printer.

After many test prints to see how far we could push our printer and found that it could print parts about 30% faster than the Prusa printer while maintaining a higher level of accuracy.
