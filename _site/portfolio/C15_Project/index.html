    For my Senior Design Project we developed and fabricated an Autonomus Moblie Robot(AMR) for Cisco Systems Work Place Resources(WPR).
This robot uses lidar and stereo vision to patrol around Cisco's cafateria towing a dirty dish cart as a part of their green initative to increase the use of reusables.

Working as two teams of 5, one focusing on the electrical and programming aspect of the robot, and my team focusing on the mechanical aspects of the robot.
Meeting weekly we quickly began brainstorming and coming together on a concept to further refine and prototype

We initially had brainstomed concepts that carried bins internally, fully encased the cart, and had built in storage for dirty dish bins, but after discussion with Cisco
we took ideas that we liked from each concept and simplified the overall design.
